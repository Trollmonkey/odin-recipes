            <p><ls>3 Leeks</ls></p>
            <p><ls>1 Large White or Yellow Onion</ls></p>
            <p><ls>2 Cloves of garlic</ls></p>
            <p><ls>1L Chicken Stock</ls></p>

        </ol>
        <h2> Cooking Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><ls>1. Begin by peeling your potatoes.  I normally wouldn't for something like mashed potatoes, but for something like potato soup, I find it really helps achieve a smoother and creamier texture.</ls></l></p>
            <p><ls>2. Pop those bad boys into the chicken stock and get some heat under them.</ls></p>
            <p><ls>3. While your stock is heating, dice your leeks and onion, making sure to clean the grit out of the leeks.</ls></p>
            <p><ls>4. Sautee the leeks and onion until softened and the onions have become translucent.  add to the pot with your stock and potatoes</ls></p>
            <p><ls>5. Bring mixture up to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Leave for 20min or until the potatoes are almost ready to break apart under a fork.</ls></p>
            <p><ls>6. Once potatoes have softened, either stick the soup in a blender or use an immersion blender to create a smooth, creamy consistency.</ls></p> 
            <ps><ls>7. Add sour cream and whisk in quickly.  Add smoked paprika and chili powder, as well as salt to taste.</ls></ps>  
            <ps><ls>8. Serve and add diced green onions on top of the bowl to garnish.</ls></ps>
        </ol>
