        <p class="descriptions">Soooo I became the biggest chungus during a long bout of depression in my late 20s, and ballooned up to nearly 350lbs.  In order to take back control of my health, I opted for a one
            meal per day chicken skillet and would have it over either brown rice or some sort of asian noodles.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheadings">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="legible">
            <li>1 Chicken Breast</li>
            <li>1 Large Onion</li>
            <li>1-2 Bell Peppers</li>
            <li>1-2 Broccoli Crowns</li>
            <li>1-2c Mushrooms</li>
            <li>2-3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>Lime Juice to taste</li>
            <li>Garlic & Chili Sauce (ie Sriracha) to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="descriptions">Now, you'll notice some variances in this recipe's ingredients.  The thing is, because I was treating this as my single meal for the day, I changed it up in small ways every day depending
            on what ingredients I had at hand, what style of dish I wanted, and what kind of veg I wanted to drive into my guts.  A lot of the time, I would substitute the lime juice for a 
            mixture of soy sauce, hoisin, and oyster sauce. With that being said, treat this recipe as a template to build off of. 
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="legible">
            <li>Mis en place, people!  Get your onion and garlic diced, and the rest of your veg and chicken all chopped into bite-sized pieces.
            <li>Start off by sauteeing your onions on med-high heat until they are translucent, or continue until they're fully caramelized.  Either is good!</li>
            <li>Add garlic, stirring for another 30s, then remove the mixture into a bowl for now.</li>
            <li>Add your chicken breast, cook to desired done-ness and add to the bowl with your onions and garlic.</li>
            <li>Throw in the rest of your veg, sautee until cooked to your liking.</li>
            <li>Add back in your chicken, onion, and garlic mixture, and add your lime juice and sriracha.</li>
            <li>Once everything's coated, serve over rice or noodles.</li>
        </ol>
