        <p class="descriptions">This is the soup I started making when my mother's cancer resulted in a surgery which left her with an ileostomy.  The soup is very simple and
            velvetty smooth to ensure she would have no blockages.  Feel free to add some grated cheese to the bowls for garnish, though I don't feel it necessary.

        <ol class="legible">
            <li>8 Large Yellow Potatoes</li>
            <li>3 Leeks</li>
            <li>1 Large White or Yellow Onion</li>
            <li>2 Cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1L Chicken Stock</li>
            <li>1 Beef Bullion Cube</li>
            <li>1c Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Smoked Chipotle Chili Powder</li>

            <li>Green Onion or Chives</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="subheadings">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="legible">
            <li>Begin by peeling your potatoes.  I normally wouldn't for something like mashed potatoes, but for something like potato soup, I find it really helps achieve a smoother and creamier texture.</li>
            <li>Pop those bad boys into the chicken stock and get some heat under them.</li>
            <li>While your stock is heating, dice your leeks and onion, making sure to clean the grit out of the leeks.</li>
            <li>Sautee the leeks and onion until softened and the onions have become translucent.  add to the pot with your stock and potatoes</li>
            <li>Bring mixture up to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Leave for 20min or until the potatoes are almost ready to break apart under a fork.</li>
            <li>Once potatoes have softened, either stick the soup in a blender or use an immersion blender to create a smooth, creamy consistency.</li> 
            <li>Add sour cream and whisk in quickly.  Add smoked paprika and chili powder, as well as salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve and add diced green onions on top of the bowl to garnish.</li>
        </ol>
